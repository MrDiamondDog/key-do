## 10/6/2025 - Idea drafting and product finding  

I went through what I wanted the device to do and how I'll make it happen. I found the exact products I need on amazon.
The device will be an ESP32 2.1in E-Ink display with 4 buttons off to the side for control. It will also have a 3000mAh rechargeable battery. 
It will show basic information including time and weather, and your to-do list of course.
The next order of business is to design the UI more clearly and draft some more features, as well as getting all the parts!

Leaving these links to the products below for me but also for documentation:
- Display and board - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9JTHTYP
- Battery - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP2JKFJG
- Buttons - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PFK5Z7L

## 10/11/2025 12 PM - Basic UI Design, BOM.yml  

Made a quick UI for the home screen in LVGL using EEZ Studio

I also found equivalent products on Aliexpress so it's cheaper, and added it to a BOM.csv

## 10/11/2025 3 PM - More Modelling!  

Did some more design work! I found a better battery and button board that will fit my needs better, and they are actually a much better price as well. I've updated the BOM to reflect this.

The case will need some more work obviously, I need to figure out the buttons and some connectors, as well as attaching the bottom part of the case and the keyring. Some revisions will definitely be needed when I receive my products. Luckily, I own a 3d printer that will make this very simple.

## 10/11/2025 7 PM - Finished the first prototype case model!  

The first prototype case model is finished! I'm going to print this off and see if attaching the two pieces works, as this is the first time I've really modeled anything with screws. It's going to use 2 M2x6 screws, since the components inside have to fit snugly, I can't really fit any more screws while still being able to put all the components inside.

## 10/11/2025 9 PM - First Print!  

…went about as well as you’d think. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of what went wrong:
- Walls were WAY too thin (literally one wall loop)
- Screw holes just don’t work at all
- Supports for said screw holes were too hard to get out

I also forgot to add the keychain part of it, but we’ll cross that bridge later.

Anyway, V2 incoming!

## 10/11/2025 10 PM - Test Print #2, Added basic UI code  

Test print 2 went a little better than last time. I increased the wall size a lot which helped a lot with the flimsyness, and overhauled the screw holes. Turns out 2mm threading does not print well on a .4mm nozzle, so I scrapped that altogether and just put a hole that is roughly the size of the screw to let it make its own threads. This worked somewhat, for some reason only one of the screw holes worked perfectly while the other one just let the screw slide around in it, despite them being the same size in the design. 

Anyway, I've added all the basic UI code in C++. For me to continue working on the project, I'll need the products to build it so I can finalize the designs and get the code past its prototype!

## 10/30/2025 - First code running on real hardware!  

The ESP finally arrived, and I immediately got started on getting some basic code to run on it. Safe to say that actually wasn’t easy at all.

I refuse to use Arduino IDE in favor of PlatformIO, as Arduino IDE is generally terrible, and I want to fine tune what I code. Unfortunately, there is absolutely 0 documentation on how to get it to actually work on PIO. It successfully uploaded the code but nothing happens on the ESP. 

After many many hours of looking stuff up, I finally found a github repo (https://github.com/todd-herbert/heltec-eink-modules) that contained a correct and working configuration file I can use. Sure enough, the code finally ran on the ESP.

Next up is getting LVGL up and running and the basic UI on the screen!
