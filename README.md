# key-do
Your to-do list on a keychain, a build for [Hackclub's Blueprint YSWS](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/)!

Inspiration for this project came from wanting gadgets on my keychain. My keychain goes with me eveywhere I go, and I figured I should make use of that. Having a little way to keep track of other little things all from my keychain sounds incredibly useful, so I started designing!

## Features
- ESP32-S3R8 with WiFi and Bluetooth
- 2.13" 122x250px E-Ink display
- 2000mAh LiPo Battery
- 4 buttons
- Lightweight, small form factor, all on a keychain!
