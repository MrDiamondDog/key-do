## 10/7/2025 - Idea drafting and product finding  

I went through what I wanted the device to do and how I'll make it happen. I found the exact products I need on amazon.
The device will be an ESP32 2.1in E-Ink display with 4 buttons off to the side for control. It will also have a 3000mAh rechargeable battery. 
It will show basic information including time and weather, and your to-do list of course.
The next order of business is to design the UI more clearly and draft some more features, as well as getting all the parts!

Leaving these links to the products below for me but also for documentation:
