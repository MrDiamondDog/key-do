## 10/6/2025 - Idea drafting and product finding  

I went through what I wanted the device to do and how I'll make it happen. I found the exact products I need on amazon.
The device will be an ESP32 2.1in E-Ink display with 4 buttons off to the side for control. It will also have a 3000mAh rechargeable battery. 
It will show basic information including time and weather, and your to-do list of course.
The next order of business is to design the UI more clearly and draft some more features, as well as getting all the parts!

Leaving these links to the products below for me but also for documentation:
- Display and board - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9JTHTYP
- Battery - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP2JKFJG
- Buttons - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PFK5Z7L

## 10/11/2025 12 PM - Basic UI Design, BOM.yml  

Made a quick UI for the home screen in LVGL using EEZ Studio

I also found equivalent products on Aliexpress so it's cheaper, and added it to a BOM.csv

## 10/11/2025 3 PM - More Modelling!  

Did some more design work! I found a better battery and button board that will fit my needs better, and they are actually a much better price as well. I've updated the BOM to reflect this.

The case will need some more work obviously, I need to figure out the buttons and some connectors, as well as attaching the bottom part of the case and the keyring. Some revisions will definitely be needed when I receive my products. Luckily, I own a 3d printer that will make this very simple.

## 10/11/2025 7 PM - Finished the first prototype case model!  

The first prototype case model is finished! I'm going to print this off and see if attaching the two pieces works, as this is the first time I've really modeled anything with screws. It's going to use 2 M2x6 screws, since the components inside have to fit snugly, I can't really fit any more screws while still being able to put all the components inside.
